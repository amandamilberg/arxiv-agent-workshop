    "|-------|----------|------------|\n",

    "| **Part 3** | Composite scoring | Combine relevance + impact for better ranking |\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **LLMs are \"polite\"** - They tend to give middle-ground scores. External signals add variance.\n",

    "2. **Multiple signals > single signal** - Combining LLM judgment with community metrics gives better rankings.\n",

    "3. **Agents make decisions** - Instead of running every tool on every input, agents reason about when tools are worth using.\n",

    "\n",
